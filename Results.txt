The input file is a list of unique words that have been extracted 
from zulumanu00001.txt. The last section (from line 2787) was excluded
because it contained english text.

The accuracy has assumed that all words given as input were correct.
So it is an approximation, it might be higher or lower because:
	1. There are words predicted to be correct but might be incorrect.
	2. There are words predicted incorrect when they are correct.

The accuracy needs a human intervention (expert zulu reader and writer maybe)
to validate it.The text files are:
1. Unique words from zulumanu00001.txt
2. Words predicted to be correct.
3. Words predicted to be incorrect.

Otherwise assuming that all input words are correct, the findings are:
Total unique words: 12453
Predicted to be correct: 10347.0
Predicted to be incorrect: 2106.0
Accuracy is: 83.08841243073958 %

Finally, since the application learns the language, its accuracy increases with use.
That is the more it is used the higher the accuracy becomes.
